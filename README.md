MyGrades is an Android App developed by [Tilman Ginzel](https://github.com/tilmanginzel) and [Jonas Theis](https://github.com/jonastheis). Its main purpose is to scrape a students grades from her/his respective university's website. To do so, it simulates a browser which follows a sequence of URLs and extracts the desired information with XPATH (web scraping). The core functionality is based on our Android App [Scrapp](https://github.com/tilmanginzel/scrapp), which we developed during our studies at the RheinMain University of Applied Sciences. Special thanks to [Rahel Habacker](https://github.com/RedHilarious)!
